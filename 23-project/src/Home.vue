            They are divided into two categories: some ask for equity % in exchange for training,
            networking and, most importantly, help in raising capital introducing you to their trusted investors and
            hosting special Demo Days; others act for
            free as they have an agreement with investors or governments.

            These are individuals or entities aiming at investing early with high risk in order to get a
            high percent of future equity. Sometimes companies rely only on business angels' capital and never take
            part in accelerators; however, accelerators provide more than just capital through their mentors.
